This is a very simple app helping christian users to pray the [Rosary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary).
It basically shows biblical texts for the mysteries in an ordered way, and simulate beads to count _Hail Mary_ prayers.
Currently, it supports English and Spanish language. The texts come from [vatican.va](http://www.vatican.va/special/rosary/index_rosary.htm).
